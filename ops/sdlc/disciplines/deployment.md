# Deployment Discipline

**Status**: Parking lot — capturing ideas as they emerge from other work

## Scope

CI/CD, infrastructure, release management, monitoring, rollback strategies.

## Parking Lot

*Add deployment insights here as they emerge during work. Include date and source context.*

### Seeded Insights

- **E2E tests in CI/CD are a deferred optimization.** [DEFERRED] When a testing process is first being established, defer CI/CD integration. Optimize for learning velocity first. Design the integration point once the testing process has proven itself. When ready, consider: pre-deploy smoke suite, post-deploy verification, Playwright in GitHub Actions. *Reason: by its own nature — defer until testing process proves itself.*

- **Breaking auth changes require deployment coordination.** [NEEDS VALIDATION] When tokens or session formats change, existing sessions become invalid. Deployment should include a communication step. The frontend 401 interceptor pattern handles it gracefully for users who stay logged in, but users with old tokens must re-authenticate.

- **Playwright runs headless by default — good for CI.** [DEFERRED] Playwright CLI can be invoked from GitHub Actions without a display server. Auth state persistence (`storageState`) handles authentication across CI runs without re-authenticating each time. *Reason: documentation fact about Playwright, not a discipline insight.*

- **Health check prerequisite pattern.** Promoted → `knowledge/architecture/deployment-patterns.yaml` (pre_deploy_readiness_checks section)
