# Architecture Discipline

**Status**: Active — backend capability assessment

## Scope

System design, component boundaries, integration patterns, technology choices, cross-project patterns. Assessing what a backend currently supports and estimating the cost of adding capabilities that unlock desired feature scope.

## Backend Capability Assessment

**When to invoke:** After competitive analysis produces a scoped feature definition with open questions, and before UX modeling finalizes the design. The backend assessment bridges "what should we build?" with "what CAN we build?"

**What it produces:**
- Backend inventory summary (API surface, database, services, auth, existing patterns)
- Capability matrix mapping feature dimensions to support levels (Supported / Partial / New / Infrastructure)
- Cost estimates with T-shirt sizing and dependency chains
- Scope recommendation organized by effort tier (ship now, quick wins, significant investment, revisit later)

**How to use the output:** Map each effort tier back to the competitive analysis scoping questions. This gives the product owner cost-aware information to adjust scope decisions.

**Knowledge store:** `knowledge/architecture/` (see inventory below)

**Pipeline position:**
```
/feature-compare → scope questions → product owner picks target scope
  ↓
/backend-assess → capability matrix, cost estimates    ← THIS
  ↓
/ux-model → IA, wireframes, specs (informed by what's feasible)
  ↓
spec → plan → implement
```
