  Migrate a project's cc-sdlc framework to the latest version — content-aware updates that preserve
  project-specific customizations (parking lots, agent names, build commands, maturity tracker) while
  updating framework sections (skills, knowledge, process docs, agents) to match the current cc-sdlc.
  Triggers on "migrate my SDLC", "update the SDLC", "migrate SDLC framework", "update SDLC framework",
  "upgrade SDLC", "sync SDLC with upstream".
  Do NOT use for first-time installation — use sdlc-initialize.
  Do NOT use when ops/sdlc/ does not exist — use sdlc-initialize.

# SDLC Migrate

Apply cc-sdlc upstream updates to a project while preserving project-specific customizations. Unlike `setup.sh` (which copies files and skips modified ones), this skill is **content-aware** — it understands which sections are framework-level vs project-customized and updates them independently.

**Argument:** `$ARGUMENTS` (optional — cc-sdlc source repo path. If omitted, check `.sdlc-manifest.json` for `source_path`, or ask user.)

## Source Repo Access Rule

**All reads from the cc-sdlc source repo MUST use git commands**, not filesystem reads. This ensures you're reading committed state, not the working tree.

- Read a file: `git -C [cc-sdlc-path] show HEAD:<path>`
- List files: `git -C [cc-sdlc-path] ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD`
- Extract a file to the project: `git -C [cc-sdlc-path] show HEAD:<path> > [project-path]/ops/sdlc/<path>`
- Diff since version: `git -C [cc-sdlc-path] diff [source_version]..HEAD`

Never use `cat`, `cp`, `ls`, or direct file reads against `[cc-sdlc-path]`. The source repo may have uncommitted work in progress.

## Pre-Flight Check

Before starting, verify this is a migration (not initialization):

```
MIGRATION ASSESSMENT
Has ops/sdlc/: [yes/no]
Has .sdlc-manifest.json: [yes/no]
Has .claude/agents/: [yes/no]
Has .claude/skills/: [yes/no]
cc-sdlc source repo: [path] (verified via `git -C [path] rev-parse HEAD`)
```

If `ops/sdlc/` doesn't exist → tell user to run `sdlc-initialize` instead and stop.

Verify the source repo path by running `git -C [cc-sdlc-path] rev-parse HEAD`. If this fails, the path is wrong — ask the user.

---

## Phase 1: Detect What Changed

### 1.1 Identify Source Version

Read the project's `.sdlc-manifest.json` to get the `source_version` (commit hash) from the last install/migration.

Then check what changed in cc-sdlc since that commit (using git, not filesystem):

```bash
git -C [cc-sdlc-path] log --oneline [source_version]..HEAD
git -C [cc-sdlc-path] diff --name-only [source_version]..HEAD
```

If `source_version` is "unknown" or `.sdlc-manifest.json` doesn't exist, treat this as a full migration — compare all framework files.

### 1.2 Changelog Review Gate

**Before categorizing or applying anything**, read the changelog entries since the project's source version.

Read `process/sdlc_changelog.md` from the cc-sdlc source repo (via `git -C [cc-sdlc-path] show HEAD:process/sdlc_changelog.md`), stopping when you reach entries older than the project's `source_version` date. This is the migration's release notes — it surfaces:

- **Breaking changes** — renamed concepts, moved files, added structural markers, changed conventions
- **New capabilities** — new knowledge files, new disciplines, new agent roles the project may want
- **Human-judgment items** — changes where the project team should decide (e.g., "do you want the new BA discipline wired to an agent?")

**Gate rule:** If any changelog entry describes a breaking change or convention rename, note it for the CLAUDE-SDLC.md compatibility check in §4.3a. If any entry describes a new capability that requires project-team input (new agent roles, new discipline areas), flag it for user review before applying.

Present a brief migration summary to the user via `AskUserQuestion`:

```
Migration summary: [source_version] → [HEAD]
- N commits, M changelog entries
- Breaking changes: [list or "none"]
- New capabilities: [list or "none"]
- Items needing your input: [list or "none"]
Proceed with migration?
```

**Gate:** Wait for user confirmation before continuing to Phase 2.

### 1.3 Categorize Changes

Group the changed cc-sdlc files by migration strategy:

| File Type | Location | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Skills** | `skills/*/SKILL.md` | Content-merge: update framework sections, preserve project customizations |
| **Agent template** | `agents/AGENT_TEMPLATE.md` | Direct copy (no project customizations) |
| **Agent suggestions** | `agents/AGENT_SUGGESTIONS.md` | Direct copy (no project customizations) |
| **Auditor agent** | `agents/sdlc-compliance-auditor.md` | Content-merge: update audit logic, preserve project-specific memory paths |
| **Knowledge YAMLs** | `knowledge/**/*.yaml` | Direct copy (cross-project, no customizations). Check for moved/deleted files (§2.1a) |
| **Process docs** | `process/*.md` | Direct copy (framework-level) |
| **Templates** | `templates/*.md` | Direct copy (framework-level) |
| **Disciplines** | `disciplines/*.md` | Content-merge: update framework guidance, preserve project parking lot entries |
| **Context map** | `knowledge/agent-context-map.yaml` | Never overwrite — project has its own agent names. Update paths for moved/deleted files (§3.3) |
| **Project agents** | Project `.claude/agents/*.md` | Targeted section updates (see Phase 3) |

---

## Phase 2: Apply Framework Updates

### 2.1 Direct Copy Files

For files with no project customizations, copy directly from cc-sdlc to the project's `ops/sdlc/` directory:

- `process/*.md`
- `templates/*.md`
- `knowledge/**/*.yaml` (but NOT `agent-context-map.yaml`)
- `README.md`, `CLAUDE-SDLC.md`
- `agents/AGENT_TEMPLATE.md`, `agents/AGENT_SUGGESTIONS.md`
- `playbooks/*.md` (unless the project has written its own playbooks — check git blame)
- `examples/*.md`

**All reads from the cc-sdlc source repo must use git commands** (e.g., `git -C [cc-sdlc-path] show HEAD:path/to/file`), not filesystem reads. This ensures you're reading committed state, not working tree.

### 2.1a Remove Deleted and Moved Files

Check the cc-sdlc changelog for files that were **deleted, moved, or renamed** since the project's `source_version`. These require explicit cleanup in the downstream project — direct copy only adds files, it doesn't remove stale ones.

**Process:**

1. From the diff in Phase 1.1, identify any files that were deleted or moved:
   ```bash
   git -C [cc-sdlc-path] diff --name-status [source_version]..HEAD | grep -E '^[DR]'
   ```

2. For each deleted file: remove it from the downstream project's `ops/sdlc/` directory.

3. For each moved/renamed file: the new location was already copied in §2.1. Remove the old location. Then check whether the project's `agent-context-map.yaml` references the old path — if so, update the path (see §3.3).

4. Log all removals so the migration report (Phase 4.6) includes them.

**Why this matters:** Without cleanup, downstream projects accumulate orphan files. Worse, if a file was moved (e.g., `knowledge/architecture/foo.yaml` → `knowledge/coding/foo.yaml`), agents mapped to the old path load a stale copy while the updated version sits unwired at the new path.

### 2.2 Content-Merge: Skills

Skills have two layers:
1. **Framework structure** — dispatch patterns, gate logic, manager rules, cross-domain injection
2. **Project customizations** — build commands, agent names, project-specific examples, tech stack references

**Migration process for each skill:**

1. Read the cc-sdlc source version of the skill
2. Read the project's version of the skill
3. Identify framework-level changes (new sections, updated dispatch logic, added/removed gates)
4. Apply those changes while preserving:
   - Project-specific build commands (e.g., `pnpm build` vs `[build command]`)
   - Project-specific agent names in tables and examples
   - Project-specific examples and terminology
   - Project-specific health check URLs and test commands
   - `[PLUGIN: ...]` guards that have been resolved to direct invocations

**Verbatim rule:** Framework content must be copied verbatim from the cc-sdlc source — do not summarize, rephrase, condense, or rewrite in your own words. The source text is the canonical version. When merging, replace the project's framework sections with the exact cc-sdlc text, then re-apply project-specific values (build commands, agent names, etc.) into the appropriate placeholders. If a framework section contains `[build command]` or similar placeholders, substitute the project's actual values — but do not rephrase the surrounding framework text.

**Key rule:** If a section exists in cc-sdlc but not in the project, add it. If a section was removed from cc-sdlc, remove it from the project. If a section was modified in cc-sdlc, update the framework logic while keeping project-specific values.

### 2.3 Content-Merge: Disciplines

Discipline files have:
1. **Framework structure** — status line, knowledge store reference, summary, mutation verification rules, level definitions (in process-improvement.md only)
2. **Project additions** — parking lot entries (with triage markers), active questions, project context sections
3. **Project-assessed data** — the Process Maturity Tracker in `process-improvement.md` (levels reflect the downstream project's state, not the source repo's)

**Migration process:**
1. Update framework sections to match cc-sdlc — **verbatim, not rephrased**
2. Preserve all parking lot entries with their triage markers (these are project-specific knowledge)
3. Preserve active questions
4. Preserve project context sections (added by `sdlc-initialize` Phase 7)
5. Add any new seeded insights from cc-sdlc that the project doesn't have — but do NOT overwrite triage markers on existing entries (the project may have triaged differently than the source repo)
6. **Preserve the Process Maturity Tracker table as-is.** The tracker is delimited by `<!-- PROJECT-TRACKER-START -->` and `<!-- PROJECT-TRACKER-END -->` markers. Everything between these markers (including the table and last-updated note) reflects the project's assessed levels — never overwrite it. Update the framework sections *outside* the markers (level definitions, assessment procedure) to match cc-sdlc. If the downstream file lacks these markers, treat the entire `### Process Maturity Tracker` section through the next heading as project data and preserve it.

### 2.4 Content-Merge: Auditor Agent

The `sdlc-compliance-auditor.md` has framework audit logic that must stay current:

1. Read the cc-sdlc source version
2. Read the project's version
3. Update all numbered sections (Core Responsibilities 1-9, severity levels, guiding principles) — **verbatim from cc-sdlc source, not rephrased**
4. Preserve the project's agent memory path
5. Preserve any project-specific audit dimensions added by the project

### 2.5 Content-Merge Verification Gate

**Before proceeding to agent updates**, verify the content-merge results from §2.2–2.4 didn't corrupt project data. This catches merge errors before they propagate into agent wiring.

**Quick checks (< 2 minutes):**

1. **Tracker integrity** — read `disciplines/process-improvement.md` and verify:
   - `<!-- PROJECT-TRACKER-START -->` / `<!-- PROJECT-TRACKER-END -->` markers are present
   - The table between markers contains the project's levels (not the cc-sdlc source repo's levels)
   - Level definitions outside the markers were updated to match cc-sdlc

2. **Parking lot preservation** — spot-check 2 discipline files:
   - Project-specific entries (dates, deliverable references) are still present
   - Triage markers (`[NEEDS VALIDATION]`, `[DEFERRED]`, `Promoted →`) were not overwritten
   - New seeded insights from cc-sdlc were added without disturbing existing entries

3. **Skill customization preservation** — spot-check 1 skill:
   - Project-specific build commands, agent names, and examples are intact
   - Framework sections were updated (compare against cc-sdlc source)

4. **Auditor agent** — verify the project's memory path was preserved (not overwritten with cc-sdlc's path)

**Gate rule:** If any check fails, fix the merge before continuing. Do not proceed to Phase 3 with corrupted content — agent wiring decisions depend on accurate discipline and knowledge state.

---

## Phase 3: Update Project Agents

Project agents are NOT framework files — they're project-specific. But some sections come from the framework template and should be updated when the template changes.

### 3.1 Identify Template-Derived Sections

These sections originate from the framework and should be updated across all project agents:

| Section | Source | Update Rule |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `## Knowledge Context` | AGENT_TEMPLATE | Must exist in every agent. If missing, add it. If present, update to match template wording. |
| `## Communication Protocol` | AGENT_TEMPLATE | Update the canonical protocol reference. Preserve domain-specific handoff fields. |
| Memory section header/guidelines | AGENT_TEMPLATE | Update generic guidelines. Preserve domain-specific "what to save" content. |

### 3.2 Apply Template Updates

For each agent in `.claude/agents/`:
1. Check if `## Knowledge Context` section exists — add if missing
2. Verify Communication Protocol references the correct YAML path
3. Verify memory section guidelines match the latest template
4. Do NOT touch: scope ownership, core principles, workflow, anti-rationalization tables, self-verification checklists, domain-specific content

### 3.3 Update Agent-Context-Map (if needed)

The agent-context-map is **never overwritten** because projects have their own agent names. But it must be updated for four scenarios:

**New knowledge files added to existing roles:** If cc-sdlc added new YAML files that are relevant to existing agents:
1. Read the project's `agent-context-map.yaml`
2. Read the cc-sdlc source's `agent-context-map.yaml` for the new mappings
3. Add new file paths to the project's existing agent entries (matching by role, not by exact name)

**New role entries:** If cc-sdlc added an entirely new role section to the agent-context-map (e.g., `business-analyst`):
1. Read the project's `agent-context-map.yaml`
2. Check if the project has an agent that matches the new role (by role name or responsibility — e.g., the project may use `ba-agent` instead of `business-analyst`)
3. If a matching agent exists: add the new role section using the project's agent name, with the cc-sdlc knowledge file paths
4. If no matching agent exists: add the role section as-is (the project can customize or remove it later)
5. Note the addition in the migration report so the project team can review the wiring

**Moved/renamed knowledge files:** If cc-sdlc moved a file from one directory to another (identified in §2.1a):
1. Search the project's `agent-context-map.yaml` for the old path
2. Replace with the new path
3. Verify the new path exists on disk

**Removed knowledge files:** If cc-sdlc deleted a knowledge file:
1. Search the project's `agent-context-map.yaml` for references to the deleted file
2. Remove those references
3. Note the removal in the migration report

Never remove project-specific mappings that aren't in the cc-sdlc source — those were added during initialization or by the project team.

## Phase 4: Verification

### 4.1 File Path Integrity

```bash
# Verify all agent-context-map paths resolve
for path in $(grep -E '^\s+- ' ops/sdlc/knowledge/agent-context-map.yaml | sed 's/.*- //'); do
  [ -f "$path" ] || echo "BROKEN: $path"
done
```

### 4.2 Agent Consistency

```bash
# Verify all agents have Knowledge Context section
for agent in .claude/agents/*.md; do
  grep -q '## Knowledge Context' "$agent" || echo "MISSING Knowledge Context: $agent"
done
```

### 4.3 Skill Verification

Spot-check 2-3 skills to confirm:
- Framework sections updated correctly
- Project customizations preserved
- No orphaned references to removed framework features

### 4.3a CLAUDE-SDLC.md Compatibility Check

The project's `CLAUDE.md` contains CLAUDE-SDLC.md content — skill names, process file paths, conventions, and workflow rules. If the migration renamed a skill, changed a convention, or modified a path, the project's CLAUDE.md will have stale references.

**Check for:**

1. **Skill name references** — verify all skill names mentioned in CLAUDE.md (`sdlc-plan`, `sdlc-execute`, `sdlc-lite-plan`, `sdlc-lite-execute`, `sdlc-idea`, `sdlc-initialize`, `sdlc-reconcile`) still match the actual skill directory names in `ops/sdlc/skills/`

2. **Process file paths** — verify paths like `ops/sdlc/process/overview.md`, `ops/sdlc/process/sdlc_changelog.md`, `ops/sdlc/process/compliance_audit.md` still exist

3. **Convention changes** — if the changelog (§1.2) flagged breaking convention changes (renamed concepts, changed workflow rules), check whether the project's CLAUDE.md still uses the old terminology

4. **New sections in CLAUDE-SDLC.md** — compare the project's CLAUDE.md SDLC sections against the current `CLAUDE-SDLC.md` source. If new sections were added (e.g., new workflow rules, new verification policies), they should be merged into the project's CLAUDE.md

**Gate rule:** If the project's CLAUDE.md references a renamed skill or removed path, fix it. Stale CLAUDE.md content causes silent process failures — Claude Code follows the instructions but they point nowhere.

### 4.4 Post-Migration Audit

Run the `sdlc-compliance-auditor` agent to verify migration integrity. The auditor's §7 (Migration Integrity) checks manifest version, framework file completeness, content-merge correctness, and stale references to removed features — exactly what needs validation after a migration.

```
"Let's run an SDLC compliance audit"
```

Fix any findings before committing the migration.

### 4.5 Update Manifest

After migration, update `.sdlc-manifest.json` with the new source version:

```bash
# Update source_version to the current cc-sdlc commit hash
```

### 4.6 Report to User

```markdown

## Red Flags

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I'll just copy all files from cc-sdlc" | Content-merge exists for a reason — direct copy overwrites project customizations |
| "The project's agent names match cc-sdlc's" | They almost never do. Always read the project's context-map, not the source's |
| "I'll skip the changelog review" | Breaking changes and new capabilities need user input before applying |
| "The tracker levels look right, I'll overwrite them" | The source repo's tracker reflects the source repo's levels, not this project's |
| "I'll rephrase the framework sections to be clearer" | Verbatim rule. Copy exactly from cc-sdlc. Do not rephrase. |
| "I'll remove this agent mapping that cc-sdlc doesn't have" | Project-specific mappings are intentional. Never remove them. |
| "No files were deleted, so §2.1a doesn't apply" | Always check. Moved files appear as add+delete pairs, not renames. |
| "I'll just read the file from the cc-sdlc directory" | Use `git -C [path] show HEAD:file` — never raw filesystem reads. The repo may have uncommitted WIP. |

## Integration

- **Feeds into:** `sdlc-compliance-auditor` (post-migration audit)
- **Depends on:** cc-sdlc source repo (reads via git), `.sdlc-manifest.json` (version tracking)
- **Uses:** `AskUserQuestion` (changelog review gate, user confirmation)
- **Related:** `sdlc-initialize` (first-time setup — use that, not this, for new projects)

## Migration vs Initialization

| Concern | Initialization (`sdlc-initialize`) | Migration (`sdlc-migrate`) |
|---------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| When | First install | Framework update |
| Agent creation | Creates new agents from scratch | Updates template-derived sections in existing agents |
| Skills | Copies from cc-sdlc | Merges framework changes into project-customized skills |
| Context map | Wires generic roles to project agents | Adds new knowledge file mappings only |
| Disciplines | Copies templates | Preserves parking lot entries, updates framework sections |
| Destructive? | No (creates new) | No (merges, never overwrites project content) |
