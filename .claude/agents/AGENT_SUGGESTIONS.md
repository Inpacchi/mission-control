# Agent Suggestions

Domain agent roles that have proven useful across projects. Each entry includes the universal expertise description you can paste into your agent's system prompt, plus suggested frontmatter. Customize the project-specific sections (file paths, package names, tech stack) for your codebase.

**Creating agents:** Always invoke `/plugin-dev:agent-development` to create agents. Do NOT write agent files directly — the skill validates frontmatter, formats description `<example>` blocks, and scaffolds the system prompt. See `AGENT_TEMPLATE.md` for the structural pattern the skill produces.
